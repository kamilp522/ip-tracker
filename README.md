## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
- [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - Leaflet opensource map
- [Ipify](https://geo.ipify.org/) - Geo ipify - IP geolocation API

### What I learned

Well, I learned that i can't hide my API key when I process it on the client-side code.

### Continued development

I'll probably try to use some framework in the future or learn more about backend development.

### Useful resources

- [Fetch Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oive66jrwBs&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) - Video by TraversyMedia, helped me understand how to use fetch api in my work

- [How to build api](https://youtu.be/khM21aJ8uOE) - This video by Ania Kub√≥w provided me a great example on how to approach building an api app. Great source.
